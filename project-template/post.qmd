## Overview

Briefly introduce the project in 2–4 sentences. State the problem, the context (course or domain), and the key outcome/result. Keep it punchy and non-technical at first.

## Objectives

- What did you aim to achieve? List 2–4 concrete goals or research questions.
- Mention relevant constraints (time, hardware, dataset, team size).

## Approach & Architecture

Describe your overall approach and the system architecture. Include a diagram if helpful.

Suggested details:

- High-level components and how they interact
- Key algorithms, models, or patterns used
- Important design decisions and their rationale

## Implementation

Summarize the tech stack and notable implementation details.

- Languages, frameworks, libraries
- Data sources and preprocessing
- Deployment/runtime environment (local, cloud, edge)
- Any automation, CI, or testing you adopted

## Results & Evaluation

Present your results with metrics, screenshots, or short clips. Provide concise interpretation:

- How did you measure success? (accuracy, latency, user feedback, etc.)
- What worked well? Where did it fall short?
- If applicable, include small tables/plots or link to more details.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

Reflect on the main challenges and what you’d do differently next time.

## Future Work

List feasible next steps, improvements, or extensions.

## Links & Resources

- Repository: <https://example.com/repo>
- Demo: <https://example.com/demo>
- Report/PDF: assets/project-report.pdf

## Writing recommendations

- Lead with a concise summary (2–4 sentences) before diving into details.
- Prefer clear headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists; avoid walls of text.
- Use figures and diagrams to explain architecture and results; add alt text.
- Cite sources and related work when relevant; link to repos and demos.
- Keep media in `assets/` and reference with relative paths (e.g., `assets/figure.png`).
- Optimize images (size and format) and avoid sensitive or confidential content.
- Add 3–8 specific categories in the front matter (technologies, topics) to improve discoverability.
- Include a license for shared code/media (e.g., CC BY 4.0, MIT) when appropriate.

Aim for clarity over completeness. Readers should grasp what you built, why it matters, and what you learned within a couple of minutes.
